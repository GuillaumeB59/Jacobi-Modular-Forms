# Lecture notes from the Valery Gritsenko's Coursera lessons
## by Guillaume Bioche

These notes were written as I followed the course on Jacobi modular forms a few years ago on Coursera. I enjoyed this course tremendously, 
but the amount of material was such that I found typing the notes in LaTex of great use.

I hope these notes can benefit to whoever is interested in this topic. Needless to say, all errors are mine. 
Hopefully you will enjoy reading them as much as I had pleasure learning about this topic while writing them.

Guillaume
