# Lecture notes from the Valery Gritsenko's Coursera lessons
### by Guillaume Bioche

These [notes](https://github.com/GuillaumeB59/JacobiModularForms/blob/main/lecture_notes.pdf) about Jacobi modular forms were written as I followed [the course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/modular-forms-jacobi) a few years ago on Coursera. I enjoyed these few weeks tremendously, 
but the amount of material was such that I found typing the notes in LaTex of great use to help assimilating.

I hope these notes can benefit whoever is interested in this topic. Needless to say, all errors are mine, thanks for pointing them out. 
Hopefully you will enjoy reading them as much as I had pleasure learning about this topic while writing them.

Guillaume
